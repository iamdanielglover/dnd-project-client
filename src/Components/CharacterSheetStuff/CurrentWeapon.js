// Spellbook calls on a list of spell ids that are saved in the database, and fetches them from the 3rd party api.
// We can search for spells in the 3rd party api, and add those spells to our backend.

// Weapons can be made manually, either through a similar process as characters are made, or statically created.
// Armor will be the same as weapons.
// We can view our weapons and armor in their subjective inventories and equip one of set of armor, and up to 3 weapons.
// Equipping armor will dynamically change the value of AC from the naked AC to the equipped AC.
